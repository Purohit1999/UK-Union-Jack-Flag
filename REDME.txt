HTML : 

This is the basic HTML structure. 
The <div id="flag"></div> is where our flag will be displayed.

CSS : 

Sets a dark background (#222, which is a dark gray).
Uses flexbox to center the content both horizontally and vertically.
Sets the body height to 100% of the viewport height.
Removes default margin and hides overflow.

Sets the flag dimensions.
Uses an inline SVG as the background image (the Union Jack design).
background-size: cover ensures the SVG fills the entire div.
transform-style: preserve-3d allows 3D transformations.
Applies a 'wave' animation (which isn't defined in this CSS, but is simulated in JavaScript).

The SVG:
The background image is an inline SVG that draws the Union Jack flag. It uses paths and clip paths to create the flag's design with the correct colors (#012169 for navy blue, #fff for white, and #C8102E for red).

JavaScript Animation:

Selects the flag element.
Initializes a time variable for animation.
The animate function:

Increments time by 0.05 each frame.
Calculates a wave value using sine function for smooth oscillation.
Applies a 3D rotation to the flag using rotateX and rotateY.
The X rotation is based on the full wave value, while Y rotation is half of that.
requestAnimationFrame calls the function again, creating a loop.


animate() starts the animation.

This code creates a wavering effect by continuously changing the rotation of the flag div. The sine function creates a smooth back-and-forth motion, and using different values for X and Y rotation gives a more complex, realistic movement.
The result is a large Union Jack flag centered on a dark background, wavering as if it's blowing in the wind.
